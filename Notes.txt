CRUCIAL: Configuring [package.json] is a pre-requisite for Jenkins CI/CD pipeline integration.
         This is illustrated below:



Basically, the execution of the Playwright scripts is driven from "playwright.config.js".
Nevertheless, one can drive the execution of their scripts from "package.json"  as well.
before proceeding into that, the content of "package.json" resembles, more or less, the following:

""    //Note: this is the original [package.json]  before configuring it in the way illustrated below:
              If you encounter any issue, revert back to it !
{
  "name": "cinco",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {   
    "test": "playwright test",
    "posttest": "node send-to-slack.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": "",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@playwright/test": "^1.52.0",
    "@types/node": "^22.14.0",
    "allure": "^0.0.0",
    "allure-commandline": "^2.34.0",
    "allure-playwright": "^3.2.1",
    "playwright-slack-report": "^1.1.89"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.8.4",
    "nodemailer": "^6.10.1",
    "playwright": "^1.52.0"
  }
}
""

 Notice that, Inside "package.json", there is the a "scripts" block. This is where you can add
 all of you custom scripts. To illustrate:
 As shown above, I have:

 
   "scripts": {   
    "test": "playwright test",
    "posttest": "node send-to-slack.js"
  },

 ********* Now, let me make a few changes, so that I now have:


    "scripts": { 
    "All": "npx playwright test --reporter=line,allure-playwright"  // ideally, you should add the allure line to every single script title below
    "smoke": "npx playwright test --grep @Smoke",
    "regression": "npx playwright test --grep @Regression",
    "API": "npx playwright test --grep @API",

    "regressionChromeOnly":  "npx playwright test --project=Chrome execution"  // or instruc. used (but doesn't work) "npx playwright test --project Chrome execution"
    // since there are, originally, double quotes wrapped around the command,remove the quotes.
    "regressionIphone12Webkit": npx playwright test --config=playwright.config1" //Under 'use' not 'project'
   
    "posttest": "node send-to-slack.js",
  },
 
  Th console command is: npm run + Script name (Example-  npm run All)
  
  The purpose behind this is- instead of giving the command of 'npx playwright test --grep @Smoke' 
  everytime I want to run my smoke tests, I would simply instead type out "smoke" voila !

  PLUS, All of this is a PRE-REQUISITE for Jenkins CI/CD pipeline integration.
