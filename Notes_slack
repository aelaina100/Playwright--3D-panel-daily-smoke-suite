First and foremost:
/*
npm install --save-dev rimraf
*/
so that, in package.json: yoiu could have
 "clean-test-results": "rimraf test-results.json",     //rimraf deletes the content of the folder so only fresh results are outputted to slack.
 "test": "npm run clean-test-results && npx playwright test --reporter=json > test-results.json",
 "posttest": "node send-to-slack.js" // this line is seperate: basically concates this command to the end of each script name in: npm (space)+ run+ scriptName
*/

//Now update what's below:
How to publish to Slack:

WARNING !!!: Even though, this popular page provides instructions on PlayWright integration with Slack
             that is indeed feasible when utilizing, at least, the options of:
              
             Option A - send your results via a Slack webhook
             Option B - send your results via a Slack bot user
            
             Nevertheless, these configurations do not provide a viable mechanism for displaying the titles
             of PlayWright tests (Passed, failed, etc.) in Slack despite the claims (This requires deeper research and reporting !)
             [https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-slack-report].

As an alternative: This version of the framework includes the workaround for resolving this issue:
A new file has been added "send-to-slack.js" with changes to "package.json" along with the indsipensible slack reporter in
PlayWright configuration file & adding the required dependecies. 
Important, even though this info comes from the query result of asking DeepSeek "How send Playwright tests reports to slack where the title of each testcase is displayed in Stack", still I had to tweak the answer in order to make the integration work !

Example of a WebHook associated with CINCO_AI slack channel: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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
and another WebHook associated with my OWN Slack channel : https://hooks.slack.com/services/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
Both of these links are, as of now, on: https://api.slack.com/apps/A08PHLVS5DF/incoming-webhooks?success=1

The command to run the tests ALONG with publishing a SLACK report is: npx playwright test && node send-to-slack.js 

// At the end of the execution, if the console displays the msg " Report is sent to Slack", but non is sent then you
// have to troubleshoot the WebHook URL on the slack api page (Last link provided above)
// and include it again in "send-to-slack.js" as
// const SLACK_WEBHOOK = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/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';


// why is this also working ?:  npm testyynpx playwright test && node send-to-slack.js

Note: SUCCESS: you just need to include the specific channel hook for the slack API website & include it in send-to-slack.js !!

2) Using chat bot: Not configured


3) Using GitHub Actions: Will be configured
